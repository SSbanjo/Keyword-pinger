Add as many keyword pings as you want and delete them if those are no longer necessary. All the added pings will be saved into a .json file so you can stop or reboot the bot at any time without losing the already added pings.

The bot will ping the role linked to the channel keyword you have set, if the keyword is found in the message content or embeds.

# Instructions
- Make sure to have all indent privileges enabled for your bot.
- Give the bot admin or high permissions on your server so it can tag any role, read messages and see all channels.
- You must fill the constants.py file with appropriate values before running the bot.
